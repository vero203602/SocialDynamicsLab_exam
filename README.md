Knowing the determinants of disease transmission is a central issue in public health [1], [4].
In fact, one central aspects is to reduce the spread of a disease. [5] Therefore, the first concern is to understand how illness can affect peopleâ€™s behaviour [6]. Understanding the behaviour changes in symptomatic individuals is central in order to control transmission.
These are very challenging tasks. Nowadays, thanks to the diffusion of mobile devices that are able to record proximity, detailed data on social interaction can be gathered. These data can then be used to create model able to predict whether an individual will be sick and his or hers change of behaviour [3] [5].
This is the starting point of our analysis.
